## Bandit

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the basics needed to be able to play other wargames.

**If you notice something essential is missing or have ideas for new levels, please let us know!**

#### Note for beginners

This game, like most other games, is organised in levels. You start at Level 0 and try to “beat” or “finish” it. Finishing a level results in information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website for “Level <X>” contain information on how to start level X from the previous level. E.g. The page for Level 1 has information on how to gain access from Level 0 to Level 1. All levels in this game have a page on this website, and they are all linked to from the sidemenu on the left of this page.

You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you are supposed to do. **Don’t panic! Don’t give up!** The purpose of this game is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is reading a lot of new information.

There are several things you can try when you are unsure how to continue:

First, if you know a command, but don’t know how to use it, try the manual (man page) by entering **“man <command>”** (without the quotes). e.g. if you know about the “ls” command, type: man ls. The “man” command also has a manual, try it. Press q to quit the man command.
Second, if there is no man page, the command might be a **shell built-in** In that case use the **“help <X>”** command. E.g. help cd
Also, your favorite **search-engine** is your friend. Learn how to use it! I recommend Google.
Lastly, if you are still stuck, you can join us via chat

You’re ready to start! Begin with Level 0, linked at the left of this page. Good luck!

**Note for VMs:** You may fail to connect to overthewire.org via SSH with a “**broken pipe error**” when the network adapter for the VM is configured to use NAT mode. Adding the setting IPQoS throughput to `/etc/ssh/ssh_config` should resolve the issue. If this does not solve your issue, the only option then is to change the adapter to Bridged mode.

### Level 0

#### Level Goal

The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.

### Level 0 - Level 1

#### Level Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
